# holla-calendar

My first go at using fullcalendar to create an events calendar in react.
â€‹

## To get started

first step -> npm i (to install all needed packages)
second step -> npm run start (to start the application)

##

add a .env and link up airtable info

### TODO

[X] editStatus does not reset once you've clicked in to editing an event. I.e. once you try to edit an event you can no longer create a new event. \
[X] timezones mess up so added events show up one day later than the day you actually add them \
[ ] Week view not working?
[ ] Investigate default client and employee on add
[ ] Error handling
[ ] Work Item Employee changes based on employee assigned to the sprint.
[ ] Work Item hours not resetting.
[ ] Drag and Drop is off by one day
[ ] End date is off by one day.
[ ] No rounded corners on end of week.
